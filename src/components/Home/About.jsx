              Hi, My name is <span className="yellow">Prabakaran </span>
              and I'm from <span className="yellow"> TamilNadu, India.</span>
              <br />
              <br />
              I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Metallurgical
              Engineering in 2022 and also I'm currently pursuing my React Js
              web developer course. I am now looking to launch my career as a
              React Js Developer. My educational background in metallurgy has
              given me a solid foundation in technical and analytical skills,
              while my training in the React Js has equipped me with the ability
              to develop innovative web applications.
              <br />
              <br />
              As a<b className="yellow"> React-Js </b>developer, I enjoy
              tackling new challenges and continuously expanding my skillset.
